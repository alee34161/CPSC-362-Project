All code should be made in the src directory.

HOW TO RUN FRONTEND:
	On Linux the command is npm start in the frontend directory.


=====================================================================================

Backend

=====================================================================================
database/test.cpp is compiled with the following command:
	g++ -o test test.cpp -I/usr/include/mysql -L/usr/lib -lmysqlcppconn

HOW TO RUN BACKEND:
	On Linux the command is node server.js in the backend directory.
	Note: We still need to implement c++ connections. Have not done that for now.
